# Zesty.xyz

The metaverse directory which indexes all of the virtual spaces that Zesty has integrated with.

- `npm start` — This will spawn a development server with a default port of `3000`.
- `npm run build` — This will output a production build in the `dist` directory.

## Custom port

You can use the `-p` flag to specify a port for development. To do this, you can either run `npm start` with an additional flag:

```
npm start -- --port 1234
```

Or edit the `start` script directly:

```
vite --port 1234
```

## Adding styles

You can use CSS files with simple ES2015 `import` statements anywhere in your Javascript:

```js
import "./index.css";
```

## Babel transforms

The Babel preset [babel-preset-nano-react-app](https://github.com/nano-react-app/babel-preset-nano-react-app) is used to support the same transforms that Create React App supports.

The Babel configuration lives inside `package.json` and will override an external `.babelrc` file, so if you want to use `.babelrc` remember to delete the `babel` property inside `package.json`.
